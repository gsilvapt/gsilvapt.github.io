# Hello, from mkdocs

For some time, I have been a fan of the Zettelkasten method and markdown, and had a self-proclaimed goal of building a site where I could share byte-sized notes about topics I deal with at work - software engineering, python and golang, cyber security, and other productivity related topics.

After seeing what [rwxrob](https://rwxrob.github.io/zet/)'s Zettelkasten has evolved into, I finally found the right setup to accomplish the above. The two main reasons I am favouring [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) over other static site generators like Hugo are:

1. Pure markdown support.
1. Built-in search engine for keywords - no more need for tags or extra work to build a search engine for my own site.

I still had the overhead of building the scripts to automatically create new notes and get them indexed for the main page but that was also a fun challenge to tackle.
