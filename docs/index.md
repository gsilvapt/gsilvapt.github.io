# Welcome to my public Zettelkasten

The sole purpose of this site is to share byte-size knowledge with the world. I hope you find it useful.

## Blog Posts vs Zettelkasten

Blogs require a lot of effort to properly write and maintain. Zettelkasten, on the other hand, is a collection of byte-sized information which I write when I encounter something know and it helps me retain knowledge on two fronts: I'm sharing it publicly, so I have to make sure it's correct, and I can refer back to it later.
