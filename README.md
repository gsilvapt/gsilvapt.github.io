# Welcome to my public notes

The sole purpose of this site is to share byte-sized knowledge with the world on various topics - from software engineering, to productivity, and all in between. It also provides a prettier UI and a decent search, as opposed to other alternatives. I hope you find it useful.

## Blog Posts vs This

Blogs require a lot of effort to properly write, curaten and tell a story. Quick notes, on the other hand, are byte-sized information which I write when I encounter something new. This practice also helps me retaining knowledge. Often, you'll only see notes which I couldn't find in other places, or these are usually summaries of many sources I searched into and so on.
